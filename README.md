Lab: UX Research + Strategy
===

## Lab Instructions
Today's lab involves improving a flawed e-commerce checkout flow.

### Part I: Research
1. **Identify an e-commerce checkout flow that needs improving.** If you're struggling to find one check out [Top 50 E-Commerce Checkouts](https://baymard.com/checkout-usability/benchmark/top-100) by Baymard Institute. Remember to examine **mobile** usability as well as desktop!
2. **Observe other users.** Partner with classmates and give them tasks to complete on your e-commerce site of choice. I don't expect you or your classmates to make purchases, but ask them to think aloud, and do take notes on your observations!
3. **Research the competition.** Who are your site's competitors? What specific things do they do better or worse than your site?

*Nothing is due from this stage, but the work you do here informs other stages.*

### Part II: Personas
Use Google Docs to tell three the stories of three users to your site. Each persona should include

* Name and photo
* Level of technical expertise
* Typical browsing behaviors
* Goals while using your site

### Part III: Strategy

In the same Google Document, prepare a UX strategy document, which should include the following

* **A vision statement**, stating the goals of this project and how those goals reflect your company's brand
* **Circumstances of use**, which is a brief summary of work done in your personas. Who uses this checkout form, and under what conditions?
* **UI design criteria**. What specific improvements will you make? Why?
* **Success metrics**. How would you measure whether your improvements are successful?
